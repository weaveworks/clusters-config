# Weave Gitops Secrets user journeys validation for FluxGA

## Can Create SOPS Secret

```gherkin
Feature: Can Create Secrets with Wego and Flux GA
  As a weave gitops platform engineer
  I want to create a SOPS secrets using Weave Gitops EE

  Background:
    Given sops infrastructure created via scripts ./docs/fluxga-validation/journeys/scripts/generate-sops.sh and
    And /eksctl-clusters/clusters/fluxga/validation-create-secrets-sops.yaml

  Scenario Outline:
    Given a sops kustomization <resourceName> from <gvk>
    When created <secretName> sops secret via the UI selecting kustomization <resourceName> for encryption
    Then a PR with the encrypted secret has been created to the secrets path in the

    When PR merged and reconciled
    Then kubernetes secret has been created with the expected value

    Examples:
      | resourceName            | gvk                                               | secretName       |
      | sops-kustomization-ga   | kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1/Kustomization      | sops-secret-ga   |
      | sops-kustomization-beta | kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2/Kustomization | sops-secret-beta |
```
